# Usage Details
Code for the shopify challenge Fall 2021.

Please make sure to have setup the following:

- node.js
- also, please make a MongoDB account: you must make sure to configurate the IP address and also add the URL to the config.js file


To ensure that all packages are installed, after cloning the repo, please make sure to run:
npm init
npm install

and then to start the server locally you must do:

node server

then copy the host address into a browser


There is a frontend which can be used.
Also, I would recommend testing using Postman. 
I am currently writing tests which can be run using 'npm run-script test', this will be pushed in the upcoming commit



This project is a work in progress:
